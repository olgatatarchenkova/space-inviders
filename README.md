<h3>Space Inviders (not really)</h3>

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen,<br>
defending against waves of alien invaders descending from the top.<br>

In my version of Space Invaders, I have implemented the game using the Python Turtle module.<br>
Player can move the spaceship horizontally using the right and left arrow keys and fire projectiles by pressing the spacebar.<br>
The objective is to eliminate all the alien invaders while avoiding their attacks.
